This repository contains networking projects built in Cisco Packet Tracer to demonstrate LAN setup, routing, and IT fundamentals.

## Small Business Network – Packet Tracer Activity

I completed a simulated small business network setup using Cisco Packet Tracer. The image below is a screenshot of a successful ping test, showing operational connectivity between different devices in the network.

### What’s in the Image
- Devices (e.g., routers, switches, PCs) interconnected to form a functional LAN.
- Demonstrates correct configuration and successful network communication.
- Validates basic network administration and troubleshooting skills.

### Skills & Tools Demonstrated
- Network topology design
- Cisco Packet Tracer usage
- LAN configuration (routing, switching)
- Troubleshooting via ping tests
- Network documentation
